        <p class = "info">I work on this in my free time lol. Notes on gamplay issues: this game is still in its pre-alpha stage so 
        a lot of things are probably broken, there is a placeholder tower on the right side of the screen, mouse listener issues also
        occur as well, and the settings page has not yet been implemented. These issues are being worked on at the moment and will be
        updated when finished.</p>
